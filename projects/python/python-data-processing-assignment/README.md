Python Data Processing Assignment

Overview
This project was completed as part of an academic Python programming course.
The assignment focuses on data processing, working with CSV files, and applying logical and structured problem-solving.

Assignment Description
The task consists of several independent questions, each implemented in a separate Python file.
The solutions involve reading structured data from CSV files, processing it according to given rules,
and producing calculated results such as averages and summaries.

Project Structure
- Ex9_Q1.py to Ex9_Q5.py: individual solutions for each question
- students.csv: input data file containing student information
- student_with_avg.csv: output file generated by the program

Files Overview
- Ex9_Q1.py: Reads student data from a CSV file and performs basic initial processing.
- Ex9_Q2.py: Calculates average values for each student based on the provided data.
- Ex9_Q3.py: Applies logical conditions and filtering on student records.
- Ex9_Q4.py: Generates summary or aggregated information from the dataset.
- Ex9_Q5.py: Writes the processed results to an output CSV file.

Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Reading and writing CSV files
- Data aggregation and calculations
- Iterative and conditional logic
- Clean and readable Python code
- Separation of logic across multiple scripts

How To Run
- Place all files in the same directory
- Run each Python file independently using Python 3

Example:
python Ex9_Q1.py

What I Learned
- Working with structured data in Python
- Translating requirements into step-by-step logic
- Writing clear and maintainable Python scripts
- Handling real input and output files

Notes
This is an academic project developed according to course requirements.
The emphasis is on clarity, correctness, and data-oriented thinking.
