SQL Practice & Analysis

This folder includes hands-on SQL work from my Industrial Engineering & Information Systems studies and independent practice.
It demonstrates practical experience with:
- Writing structured SQL queries.
- Working with relational databases.
- JOINs, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries.
- Data validation and basic analytical queries.

The focus is on clarity, logic, and using SQL to extract meaningful insights relevant to Data, BI, and Business Analyst roles.
