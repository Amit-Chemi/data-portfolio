BIU Shoes – SQL Database Project

This project was completed as part of a Database Systems course.
The goal was to design, populate, and query a relational database for a fictional shoe store called BIU Shoes.

The project demonstrates practical SQL usage combined with Python scripts for database interaction.

Problem Overview
BIU Shoes is a growing footwear company that needs a structured database to manage:
- Shoes and sizes
- Customers and locations
- Orders and sales
- Upcoming special edition releases

Database Design
The database includes multiple related tables, such as:
- shoes, sizes, and shoe_size
- customers, cities, and countries
- orders, order_shoe, and order_customer
- upcoming releases linked to shoes

Foreign keys and constraints are used to maintain data integrity.

Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Python (mysql.connector)

Key Queries and Analysis
The project includes analytical queries that answer business questions, including:
- Revenue generated by each customer
- Average shoe price by size
- Shoe availability by number of sizes
- Identification of unsold shoes
- Sales summary per shoe using a database view
- Combined inventory and upcoming releases for marketing use

What I Learned
- Relational database design based on business requirements
- Writing readable and well-structured SQL queries
- Using joins, aggregations, and views
- Translating business questions into SQL logic
