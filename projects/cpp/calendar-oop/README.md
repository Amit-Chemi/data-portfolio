C++ Calendar and Date Management Project

Overview
This project was completed as part of an academic C++ programming assignment.
The goal was to design and implement a small object oriented system for managing dates
and a calendar, while practicing class design, encapsulation, and separation between
header and implementation files.

Project Description
The project includes two main classes:
- MyDate: represents a date object and handles date related logic
- Calender: manages a collection of date objects and related operations

The program demonstrates how multiple classes interact, how objects are stored and
managed, and how functionality is split between interface (.h) and implementation (.cpp).

Project Structure
- MyDate.h / MyDate.cpp: date representation and date related operations
- Calender.h / Calender.cpp: calendar class that manages multiple dates
- main.cpp: program entry point and basic usage of the classes

Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Object oriented programming in C++
- Class design and encapsulation
- Use of header and source files
- Dynamic memory handling and object management
- Clear separation of responsibilities between classes

How To Build And Run
Using Visual Studio:
- Open the project or solution file
- Build the project in Debug or Release mode
- Run the executable from the IDE

Using command line:
- Compile all cpp files together
- Example:
  g++ main.cpp MyDate.cpp Calender.cpp -o calendar_app
- Run the executable

What I Learned
- Designing classes based on a given specification
- Managing interactions between multiple objects
- Debugging compile time and runtime errors
- Writing cleaner and more structured C++ code

Notes
This is an academic project developed according to course requirements.
The focus is on correctness, clarity, and object oriented design rather than advanced libraries.
